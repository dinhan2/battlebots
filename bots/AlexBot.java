/**
 * The strategy is to primarily avoid bullets, by staying in one place for most of the time (like Sentry bot),
 * when bullet is heading towards Bot, then it must travel in a opposite direction where it cannot be hit. It
 * will also check the surroundings for a dead bot and to move in the other direction.
 * If there is no danger to be hit by bullet, then Bot can fire its own bullet, towards where closest
 * enemy bot will be within a double radius of the Bot(it increases chance of enemy bot will get hit - since we must conserve bullets)
